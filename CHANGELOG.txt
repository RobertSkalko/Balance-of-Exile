v.1.1.2
Add "free kill" feature, chunks now have a one time amount of free kills you are allowed before the penalty starts.
Opening chests also adds an amount of free kills backs.

This feature is meant to make tall towers a viable way to get loot, while still staying true to the mod's ideal of punishing mob farms.
